# Traffic-Flow-Analyzer-4COSC001W-Software-Development-I-Coursework-2024-
A Python program for analyzing traffic data from CSV files, helping local councils make informed decisions. It processes vehicle counts, identifies trends, and visualizes data using histograms.

## Features
- **Input Validation**: Ensures accurate date selection and data integrity.
- **Processed Outcomes**: Provides statistical insights, such as the total vehicles passing, percentage of trucks, peak traffic hours, and more.
- **Save Results**: Outputs analysis results to a text file for easy reference.
- **Graphical Representation**: Generates histograms showcasing hourly traffic volumes across junctions.
- **Loop Code**: Allows council staff to process multiple datasets efficiently.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:  
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
3. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.8 or higher).
4. Install required libraries (like `tkinter`, if necessary):  
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```
5. Run the Python file and follow the on-screen instructions:
   ```bash
   python A_B_C_D_E.py
   ```

## Expected Deliverables
- Python code for traffic data analysis.
- Text file with summarized outcomes (`results.txt`).
- Histograms for visual traffic representation.

## Learning Outcomes Addressed
- Analyze problems and design algorithmic solutions.
- Apply programming concepts to develop functional code.
- Implement and manipulate data structures.
- Create programs using integrated development environments.
